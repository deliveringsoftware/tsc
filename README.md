# ===Update===

## After to postpone many times to really put effort on this project, on the last days, it really happened. There are much work to do. 
## But I'm seize the opportunity, as an Microsoft MVP focused on DevOps, to test the new feature of VSTS: Public projects!

# That is why I'm moving the code to: [https://teamsecurityascode.visualstudio.com/tsc](https://teamsecurityascode.visualstudio.com/tsc)

## This project is directly related with VSTS, and thinking about dog food it's make sense.
